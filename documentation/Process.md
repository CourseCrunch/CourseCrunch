## Process For The Project

#### Team Organization (Roles) 

As explained in our Team.md most of our roles pertaining to front end work and back end work will be assigned sprint by sprint based on the task and interest, since many group members wish to experience both aspects throughout this project.

Each team member holds their own functional roles as well to ensure quality and timely submissions for our project. These roles are:

**Krish Chowdhary** - Ensures all required work is submitted on time, books rooms

**Naaz Sibia** - Ensures all required work is submitted on time, lunch buddy

**Wan Song Lee** - Reviews technical and functional deliverables

**Ritvik Bhardwaj** - Reviews technical and functional deliverables, initiates standup meetings

**Justin Pham** - Ensuring the product backlog is up to date

**Liam Aiello** - keeps track of deadlines and ensures we are on track to complete tasks on time

**Robert Westhaver** - Takes notes on meetings and direction of app

#### Decision Making

Our decision making process is fairly simple. Generally when it comes to large decisions such as what app we wish to develop, direction we wish to go with our chosen app, etc.. We usually pose the question online in our discord chat the week before our face-to-face meeting. From there, for the days leading up to the meeting we all think of possible solutions to the decisions/problems, bounce ideas off each other and refine said ideas. 

During our meeting, when the topic is presented, we each list off all of our ideas that we have on the subject. Once all of our ideas are listed we then open up discussion about each idea so that we can try to fully explore it, and see if it fits with all of our goals. This process usually eliminates some of the ideas off our board. Once the ideas are fully explored we then begin voting on the ideas we want. There is no limit to the amount of items each person can vote for, in the end the item with the most votes is what we choose as the solution. 

Due to our voting structure, there is a chance of a tie happening during the voting process. If this is the case, we do one of the following options depending on the problem we are solving.

1. We explore the ideas that are currently tied further, draw potential critiques and positive things about the idea, then take another vote for the tied ideas
2. We try to combine elements from the tied ideas to come up with a solution that everyone can agree upon - this solution is highly dependant on how related the ideas are and scope of our problem
3. We accept the tied solutions as quoted in lecture 3 by Gregory Corso - this is dependant on the type of the problem, its scope and our time constraints we allocate for it

#### Prioritizing User Stories

When defining our priority for our user stories we took some criteria from the Kano model, and asked ourselves functional and dysfunctional questions relating to the user stories for our app so that we would be able to gauge the desirability of each user story. We then broke our user stories down into core features, high-value features, and nice-to-haves.

**Core Features** - the user stories for features in our app that are required for the app itself to function, and for it to serve its core purpose.

**High-Value Features ** - the users stories which we assessed to be very desirable by our users, and have reasonable to low cost

**Nice-to-Haves** - user stories for features that our users agree are nice to have, but did not assess greatly when evaluating desirability, or may have high risk/cost.

We were then able to assign up to 5 points to each user story based on the hierarchy of their respective section, and their cost. For example, core features would receive the highest points between the 3 sections, each user story in the core features section will receive points based on their hierarchical needs (a core feature that other core features rely on would receive more points), next would be high value user stories, each being ranked by how well received each user story was, etc..

It is hard to gauge how many rounds of voting it takes to come to a consensus for user stories. Technically it is one voting round, however we usually spend time to debate with each other where we think it belongs first, so that when it comes to voting we all usually agree with one another. However later as we give point estimates to other user stories we may change up previous decisions as we may realize we prioritized said tasks too much or too little.

#### Meetings

There are 2 main forms of meeting, online and in person. Every day, our team meets for 10 minutes online for our standups through teams. We then have a face-to-face meeting every Thursday after our 301 tutorial ends at 12pm; the meeting usually occurs in a booked study room, however if there is a case where no room is available or a last minute meeting is required, then Robert's house is the alternative option since it is near campus. 

Our typical online meeting revolves around discussing what each person is currently working on, if they are on track, and whether they feel they may require assistance in their task. This meeting also serves to remind or alert the group of upcoming deadlines, planned absences, etc.. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure that our team is kept aware of what everyone else is currently working on, potential events that may effect workflow, and what to expect for our team to achieve by the next sprint.

Our typical face-to-face meeting revolves around larger issues. This is where we discuss items that require some decision making process to occur, where we see our tasks/the overall project going, and where we may pose questions to the team on how they feel about certain criteria/compromises for a task. 

There may be cases where additional planning on a topic is required, or many decisions need to be made within a short period of time, in which more face-to-face meetings will be booked within the week instead of only 1 per week.

#### Next Phase

We feel some lessons that we should take with us to the next phase would be:

1. Planning out our meeting structures with realistic goals to cover within the scheduled time - there have been times where we think we will be able to cover every topic that we want to for our meeting, however we run out of time before making it to them; this sets us as back as some of our tasks rely on us going over said topics.
2. Spreading out data sources instead of relying on the couple data sources we came up with at first - when we first came up with the idea, we thought it was completely unique and we would only need a couple data sources; however when looking into the competition we realized that there were pre-existing apps, and apps currently under development which try to do a similar thing with the exact same data sources as ours. Thus we now need to scramble to try to find more data sources to aid in diversifying our app more.
