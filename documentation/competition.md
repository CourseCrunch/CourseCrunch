From some personal anecdotes and quick web searches, the primary competitors for [Product Name] are: Word of mouth, reddit/forums and websites like [uoftprofs](http://uoftprofs.com) or [birdcourses](https://birdcourses.com).

### Word of mouth:

This is one of the primary competitors to [Product Name] since it is one of the more intuitive methods of assessing course quality. Having someone who has taken the course previously is a great resource as it can be as thorough as one chooses. Although, where our product loses out in the specificity afforded by a human resource it succeeds in other ways. A person has limited availability and will not always be able to answer questions with the immediacy of our application.  The barrier to entry for retreiving information from other people who know of the course is also much higher requiring moderate levels of social interaction with the resource. Information through a human resource is also primarily anecdotal whereas our product provides information based on a larger scale sample.

### Reddit/Forums:

This method has always been a popular option as it can provide the specificity of word of mouth while affording the user their anonymity thus, breaking down the social barrier. Although anonymity is a strength of forums, it is also a weakness where the natural vetting of resources done in word of mouth is not available. Forums are generally public and just as anyone can post a question, likewise just about anyone can post an answer. The problems forums face in answer accuracy are mitigated by having multiple users that will hopefully correct incorrect posts, but it is never guaranteed. Also unlike with word of mouth, there is generally no guarantee that another user will even answer a question posted where some response is generally expected using word of mouth. Convenience-wise, it benefits from being a digital platform like our application and can hold that over simple word of mouth methods. Aside from the points mentioned above, the differences between forums and word of mouth are minor and so places where our application win over word of mouth also apply to forums whether it be availability of accuracy.

### uoftprofs.com

uoftprofs is a web tool that visualizes the UofT course evaluation data set to assess professor proficiency for particular courses. It provides a similar functionality to our application but where uoftprofs simply assesses professors, our application assesses courses and provides features for course planning and selection. Both our application and uoftprofs provides the same levels of specificity in terms of information as they will be working on the same data set. In terms of usability, our application is expected to be superior to uoftprofs as it should require less specific direction by a user ie. not requiring a professor name and course code for each search. All in all, although our applications are similar, they fulfill different niches for students at UofT.

### birdcourses.com

birdcourses.com is a user driven data repository for courses from several university. It's evaluations for the courses are based on user input and thus encounters similar issues found with the forum approach. Its user base for UofT is small so most courses have only a few ratings whilst many courses are not featured at all. Since our application is not reliant on user data it avoids the need to have a large relevant user base to cover the breadth of courses offered by UofT. What birdcourses.com does offer is the information on many courses at several universities across the US and Canada. Universities other than UofT are outside the scope of our application given the limited availability of consistent course evaluation data and our intended scope. Like forums and word of mouth, birdcourses.com's reliance on user data gives our application an advantage due to the data sets in the application's backbone. birdcourses.com also lacks the much of the functionality of our application, but makes a tradeoff  for being able to cover multiple universities. So, birdcourse.com functions for other universities, but fails to measure up to functionality expected from our application for our primary demographic of UofT students.
