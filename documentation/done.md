**Course Crunch**’s first release will be in **April, 2020**. In this release, the users must be able to login and create a profile in which the user must be able to provide personal information such as the previous courses taken and their email. The users must also have access to at least three different microservices. The main services include: Course Statistics, Waitlist Notifications, and Course recommendations.

In terms of _Course Statistics_, users should be able to search and view the course evaluation data for any UTM course or professor. Statistics such as the average ratings for each question in the course evaluation; and a timeline showing the changes in course ratings over time. Users should be able to view reviews from other websites such as _RateMyProf_ and be able to add their own reviews anonymously directly to the website.

Users should have the ability to _filter courses_ based on provided input and be able to sort the courses based on selected predicates such as lowest course toughness or highest recommendation level.  

In terms of _Waitlist Notifications_, users should be able to dynamically add or remove waitlisted course sections for multiple courses at a time. Once the user has added a section, they should be notified via email when the status of any chosen waitlist has changed. The waitlisted course selections should also be automatically removed once the Course Deadline has passed.

In terms of _Course Recommendations_, the users should be able to select which criteria they would like to recommend courses on such as, easiest non-conflicting courses or best course in a certain major. Also, the Course recommendations should take into account the user’s current schedule if applicable. Users should be able to blacklist courses that they would not want recommended.

If time permitted, minor features such as _CGPA calculator_ and a _FAQ chatbot_ may be added.
