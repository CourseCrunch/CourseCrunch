											## 							Course Crunch



### Background:

**Course Crunch** is a web application designed and developed by a team of 7 students studying at the University of Toronto at Mississauga. 
At the University of Toronto, students complete evaluations for courses they took at the end of each course, anonymously. This helps the university to “collect formative data for instructors to improve their teaching, to provide summative data for administrative purposes (such as annual merit, tenure, and promotion review) and for program and curriculum review, and to provide members of the University community, including students, with information about teaching and courses at the university” [1]. 

To allow students and other members of the university to see course evaluation data, the data is published online for everyone to see. {Insert Name} uses this public data to provide course insights and visual representations of course evaluations to users in order to help members see the data in a simpler, and easier to read form.
