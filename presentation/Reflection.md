# BoundlessBytes Reflection

### **Successful Tools/Techniques/Conventions** 

Some tools/techniques that worked really well within our team would be the our version control system, testing framework, and separating our service into micro services.

Our version control was a success as we were able to prevent broken commits, merge conflicts and substandard work from entering into our master branch. This kept our final code clean, reliable and standardized which especially served us well when beginning tasks that were unfamiliar to some members (so we have a good implementation of what we are trying to do to reference in master) and when presenting the product.

Our testing framework consisted of a single command bash script which would launch our micro-services all together, allowing us ease of testing and development, without needing to open and manage multiple terminal processes. Our framework also used hot reloading allowing us to develop and recompile the product with ease on the spot.

Finally diving our service into microservices really helped as it created High cohesion while maintaining low coupling, it also kept our tasks organized and separate with very minimal amounts of merge conflicts to worry about.

### **Unsuccessful Tools/Techniques/Conventions**

 An tools/techniques that were less successful would be online work sessions, scheduling these when working at home during the COVID-19 quarantines became a hassle as people felt less inclined to have it strictly at a set time, people became unsure about if we were continuing to do the sessions on certain days.

### **BoundlessBytes Ideal Process**

If we were to meet up again as a team for a project. The ideal process would first include reflecting what type of story we have a preference for (originally we had no idea if we had a preference for front end or back end, however now that we have experienced both stacks we can now make an educated choice as to where we will excel in development). We will then follow the same meeting structure as we have from the beginning where we meet at the beginning of each sprint to discuss direction and planning, meet every other day for a standup, and hold a retro at the end of each sprint where we point out what may have gone wrong and how to improve.

Secondly, we would use the same version control standards we employed during this project, such as using pull requests to merge to master, as this was key to a clean production environment. We would also begin using linting straight at the beginning, linting being a way for us to standardize our code for easier reviewing of PRs. We originally introduced this in the middle of the project and noticed how much faster the process became. 

Finally we would hold in person work sessions weekly, this served as an effective tool to encourage our team to work since instead of being left on our own to procrastinate, we are grouped together in an environment that encourages working since we are surrounded by our fellow team members. These work sessions also allowed for team members to communicate and help each other more effectively.
