### Methods of Communication

We will be primarily communicating through a Discord server with all members. Additonally, we also have Facebook Messenger which we can use for daily communication. 

### Preferred phone number, email address, etc.

As mentioned above, we are all in a shared group channel on Discord and Messenger. We additonally have shared our phone number and emails with all group members. 

### Communication Response Times

We are capping internal message response time at 4 hours accross channels, since we are all active on the channel mentioned above there should be very few instances where this cap is reached. 

### Standups and Other Agile Meetings

We will be meeting face to face once a week, directly after our CSC301 Tutorial. Additionally, we will have daily 10-min meetings on our Discord server to make sure everyone stays on the same track. During the weekly and daily meetings, Robert will handle meeting minutes. 

### Meeting Preparation

Each member should come prepared with a summary of their progress over the sprint and major design decisons that were made. If a group member was unable to compete their sprint on time, and should come to the retro meeting with lessons learnt and an action plan to catch up for the next sprint. Although no formal slides or documents are required, high-levels would be benefical. 

If any group member wishes to stop working on a given user story, they must come prepared to transition the user story to another member. At the minimum, this would include notes on the current progress of the user story along with challenges faced, strategies attempted and lessons learnt over the previous sprint.

### Version Control
Commit atomically, and frequently. Don't commit minor changes. Each commit message should follow the standards mentioned here: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for a good commit message, i.e.:
1) Separate subject from body with a blank line
2) Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3) Capitalize the subject line
4) Do not end the subject line with a period
5) Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6) Wrap the body at 72 characters
7) Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Roles and Division of Work
Roles will assigned sprint by sprint and based on group members skillsets interests, early on, the majority of the teams focus will be defining the backend and high priority endpoints. 

The work done each sprint will be based on the priority of the user stories, each member will aim to take on a sufficent number of stories. The priority system of user stories will be on a range of 1-5, with 5 being large critical stories. Each member will aim for an average of sprint priority 4 through the project, this could be several smaller tickets or one large ticket. If one member has a heavily sprint (i.e., total over 5) then they should follow this with a lighter sprint.

### Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software
1) We wil submit everything required in sprint at least one day before deadline to prevent last moment changes and as a buffer 
2) Krish and Naaz will submit all the required work 
3) Ritvik and Wan will review the technical and functional deliverables

### Contingency Planning
1) If a team member drops the course, the remaining team members will try to distribute their user stories evenly. Since we aim to make
our user stories independant, the division should not be an issue.
2) It if a team member misses meetings or does not complete agreed upon tasks on time we will try to contact them and talk to them to find
out why they've been doing so. We will warn them that if this persists, then we will not be able to continue working with them, and they will not get graded well. We will also inform Professor Dema that they have not been working using the anonymous feedback feature that we have in every sprint to ensure the team member does not get graded for our work while they were slacking off. If the reason was important like a health reason, death in the family, then we will tell the member to talk to Professor Dema. We wouldn't want to penalize a member for an emergency like that.
3) If a team member is academically dishonest:
i) ... and hasn't submitted work: we will ask them to complete the work in an academically honest manner
ii) ... and has submitted work: we will let Professor Dema know because this is a case for the Dean to handle.
