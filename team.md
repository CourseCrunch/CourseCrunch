### Methods of Communication

We will be primarily communicating through a Discord server with all members. Additonally, we also have Facebook Messenger which we can use for daily communication. 

##### Preferred phone number, email address, etc.

As mentioned above, we are all in a shared group channel on Discord and Messenger. We additonally have shared our phone number and emails with all group members. 

### Communication Response Times

We are capping internal message response time at 4 hours, since we are all active on the channel mentioned above there should be very few instances where this cap is reached.
